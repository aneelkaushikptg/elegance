                        Aza, which means 'desire' in Sanskrit, was founded in 2005 by Dr. Alka Nishar.
                        Her vision was to create a friendly, welcoming space that showcases the best of
                        luxury Indian fashion for women and men. At Aza, a seasoned team of experts scrutinizes
                        the latest collections and curates key pieces for the season. Ace designers Manish Malhotra,
                        Anamika Khanna, Varun Bahl, Sabyasachi, Anita Dongre, Monisha Jaising, Neeta Lulla, Gaurav Gupta,
                        and Anushree Reddy are amongst the 200 carefully selected and presented names. In addition to
                        established labels, Aza is dedicated to discovering and introducing emerging talent from around
                        the country. It has, in the past, sponsored the Gen Next show at Lakme Fashion Week and served as
                        a launch pad for several designers including Rahul Mishra, Nachiket Barve & more.
                        Through Aza Fashion's NEXT, a talent incubation platform in collaboration with the Fashion Design
                        Council of India, Aza identifies four promising designers annually and commits to supporting their
                        growth. Aza also styles real life couples in statement designer wear on India's most popular wedding
                        show, Yarri Dostii Shaadi on NDTV Good Times and thus continues its legacy of being a one-stop
                        destination from brides and grooms.
